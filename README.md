# sqlalchemy-challenge

This assignment was a bit trickier for me, so I relied heavily on the iCloud recordings, the starter code, and Stack Overflow. I also used geeksforgeeks.org and w3schools.

There were a few instances where I knew what my code should look like, but I didn't fully understand what the code was actually doing in my program. Since I wanted to fully comprehend the assignment, in about four or five instances, I asked chat.gpt to 
"break down [specific syntax] and explain it to me in layman's terms," but I never used ChatGpt to generate actual code. I only used it to explain code that I had already written (and which seemed to run properly) but which I didn't fully comprehend.
